Here are some temporary changes I made, to make my own testing easier.



Context.py

A script to collect context to pass to a LLM.


Context.txt

The output of Context.py


ContextList.txt

The file with the parameters for Context.py


Main.py

I added an option to save to a folder instead of a zip file.  I found that more convenient for testing.


pytest.ini

filterwarnings =
    ignore:.*Getting options from multiworld is now deprecated.*
    ignore:.*Using per_slot_randoms is now deprecated.*

The console was full of these messages when running pytest on alttp, so I disabled them.


pytest_output.txt

Output from pytest


frontend/test_output_raw_rules.txt

Used for debugging, not needed for release


NewDocs/project-notes.txt

Some scrap notes about the project.


NewDocs/scrap.txt

A scrap text file.


worlds/alttp/test/vanilla/TestCustom.py

Obsolete, it was replaced with the code in test/bases.py


worlds/ladx/Options.py

I made an update to skip running these lines when running through pytest, because they generate an error due to loading the wrong folder for the sprites:

import sys

...

    if not 'pytest' in sys.modules:
        for file in os.listdir(__spriteDir):
            name, extension = os.path.splitext(file)
            if extension in extensions:
                __spriteFiles[name].append(file)
