That's the end of the files you need for context.  Now here are your instructions:

The next thing I want you to do is find a way to fully automate the test process.

The test process currently starts by running this test profile in VSCode:

        {
            "name": "Python: TestLightWorld",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "pytest",
            "args": [
                "worlds/alttp/test/vanilla/TestLightWorld.py::TestLightWorld",
                "-v",
                "--capture=tee-sys",
                "-o", "log_cli=true",
                ">", "pytest_output.txt"
            ],
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        },

The test process is currently bottlenecked by needing to manually open the browser to open test_runner.html, let the page run its tests, and save the outputs to test_results.json

I want a way for the Python test scripts to do this automatically, without having to manually open a browser.
