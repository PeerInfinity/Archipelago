That's the end of the files you need for context.  Now here are your instructions:

We just finished making some large changes to both the backend and the frontend.

The main change is that the helper functions are now handled in the frontend, rather than trying to break them down into a tree of simpler rules.

Look at the documentation for things that need to be updated.

Write updated versions of the documentation files.

If you have any questions, then please ask them.

Other recent changes include:

We recently updated analyzer.py to handle all of the cases we currently know of that it needs to handle.

We just finished setting up debug_logs_automated.json to contain debug information that we want.

As part of this process, the “result” structure has changed.  Some things that were previously in “result” are now in “result.result”
