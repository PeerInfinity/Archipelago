That's the end of the files you need for context.  Now here are your instructions:

The task that we’re currently working on is to integrate the Archipidle console with the rest of the frontend UI.

The code for the frontend, including the Archipidle console, is in the “frontend” folder.

The console was designed to run on its own, and it will need some changes to integrate with the rest of the UI.

The UI will need to keep track of whether the console is connected.

When the console is not connected, everything in the UI will work the same way it currently does, with stateManager fully in charge of managing the game state.

When the console is connected, the console will be responsible for handling the data that it has read and write commands for.

When the console is connected:

The user can type commands into the console as normal.

When the user clicks on a button to perform a location check, instead of stateManager immediately performing the check, a check command will instead be sent through the console.

When the user clicks on an inventory item, instead of that item being immediately added to the inventory, a command will be sent through the console to add the inventory item.

When the console receives a message from the server with an update about the state of the inventory or checked locations, the UI will update its state to stay synchronized with the state on the server.

When the console first connects, it will send a command to get the full list of inventory items and checked locations. The UI will then update with that information.

The “Archipidle” feature will also be integrated with the rest of the UI. The timer will run as normal, but instead of having its own list of items and locations, it will integrate with the data in stateManager.

When the timer says it's time to run a check, it will read the list of available locations, and perform a check on the first available location in the list. We might want to add an option later to pick a random available location instead.

If there are no currently available locations, then no check will be performed, and the timer will reset.

To connect to the host, enter
ws://localhost:38281
As the Server Address, and
Player1
As the Slot Name

Don't start writing any code yet.  Just examine the current state of the code, summarize what is left to do, and ask any questions you have.
