That's the end of the files you need for context.  Now here are your instructions:

Look at the current state of the code, and the test results.

Identify at least one issue that's contributing to the test failures.

Propose an outline of a plan for how to begin work on fixing the issues.

The code to propose changes to is in worlds/generic/RuleParser and in frontend.

There is no restriction on proposing dramatic changes to the way the RuleParser or frontend are implemented, if that's what's required to fix the issues.

If you want to see the contents of other files, please tell me and I will provide them.

If you want to add trace messages to the code and look at the output, we can do that.

If you have any other questions, then please ask them.

When we left off, we fixed some issues in analyzer.py that were causing the data in test_output_rules.json to be invalid.
